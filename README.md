# ApacheCamelRouterExample

This is a simple project which is comprised of three Spring boot applications that read text, xml or json files from a directory and route them to an ActiveMQ. It then reads them from the queue and routes them to separate ActiveMQs based on file name. While it is sending them to seperate queues it also saves the information(payload) in a MongoDB. Each Spring Boot does one specific task(loosely coupled). One reads from a directory and routes to an ActiveMQ, and this needs to be run first. The next one reads from the queue and saves the payload to a MongoDB and also reroutes each file to a separate queue based on file name, and this needs to run next. This application will actively listen for new files added to the directory and it will route them to the necessary location. Finally the last Spring Boot Application can is used to query the mongoDB. Aside from built in query functions provided by MongoRepository there is also a custom method to query a paylod based on file name.
